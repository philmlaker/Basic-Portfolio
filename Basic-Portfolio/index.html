	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<hr>


		<img class="picture" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Fox_study_6.jpg">
		<p> Born and raised in 3 feet of snow in northern Minnesota. I graduated with a BS degree in biology and chemistry minor in 2010 and subsequently moved to Denver, CO right after. In 2013 I became certified as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist through ASCP and began working in the Molecular and Virology Department at University of Colorado Hospital. </p>

		<p> Moved to Austin in 2015 and absolutely loving it. Austin is the city I was meant to live in. I love the weather, the people, and the the city. I am so happy I moved here. I love Torchies Tacos and the Salt Lick.</p>
